## Introduction
Welcome to 개화, your personalized AI-driven skincare subscription service. Experience the moment of your skin's blossoming with us.

## Problem
Despite abundant information on cosmetic ingredients, many customers struggle to find the right products for their skin. Our goal is to help you recognize your skin's current condition and find optimized care products.

## Solution
- **Monthly Reviews**: Upload a monthly photo and brief description of your skin condition.
- **AI Recommendations**: Our AI uses these inputs to diagnose and recommend suitable products.
- **Subscription Kit**: Receive a monthly kit with products tailored to your skin's needs.

## Competitive Edge
- **화애 (Hwahae)**: Provides ingredient info but can overwhelm with too much data.
- **닥터지 (Dr.G)**: Offers AI skin analysis but only recommends its own products.

Our AI system offers personalized recommendations, using advanced multi-modal models to find the best products for you.

## Financials
- **Revenue Model**: Subscription service with potential ad-based discounts.    

## Future Plans
- Build a database of optimal cosmetics.
- Create custom products based on customer needs.
- Expand globally, starting from Korea.
